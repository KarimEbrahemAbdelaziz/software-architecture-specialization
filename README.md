## Definitions
- Software design: Looks at the lower-level aspects of a system;
- Software architecture: Looks at the higher-level aspects of a system;

## Principles
- Simplicity first! Make knowledge transfering low;

## Observations
- Try playing with people much better than you;
- Architecture represents significant decisions, where significance is measured by cost of change;
    - Significant decisions:
        - Architecture (Programming language, architecture style)
        - Design
        - Implementation (Indenting tabs)
- Base your architecture on requirements, travel light and prove your architecture with concrete experiments (Poc, prototype, spike, tracer, vertical slice, walking skeleton, executable reference architecture, etc)

## Issues due to lack of architecture
- Big ball of mud
- Spaghetti code
- Inconsistent approaches to solving same problems
- Quality attributes ignored
- Deployment problems
- Maintenance issues

## Important questions
- Does the picture reflect what we want to build?
- Is it going to work?
- Have you identified and mitigated the highest priority risks?
